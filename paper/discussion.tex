\begin{itemize}
    \item Tor is working on a new onion service design~\cite{Mathewson2013a}.
        Anything we can say about that?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our demographic may not be representative because we selected people
        who may care more about onion sites than the average Tor user.  Many
        Tor users may do nothing other than download Tor Browser.
    \item Our survey was only in English, so it may not generalize well to
        non-English speakers.  We know that there are cultural differences in
        security behavior~\cite{Sawaya2017a}.
\end{itemize}
