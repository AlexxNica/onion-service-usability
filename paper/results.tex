\subsection{Participants}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide intuition on how much our sample resembles the general
        population.
    \item From when to when did we disseminate our survey?
    \item How many participants did we attract?
    \item How long did it take to complete the survey?  Provide some descriptive statistics.
    \item What's the female/male ratio?
    \item What's the age distribution?
    \item What's the level of education?
    \item What's the computer security knowledge?  Note that our participants
        may overestimate their knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Random anecdotes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In pre-test: one person considered the onion domain itself
        confidential and was worried about the domain's prefix revealing
        anything about its content.
\end{itemize}
