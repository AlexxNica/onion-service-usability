\section{Interview questions}
\label{app:interview-questions}

We started the interview by handing our interviewees the consent form and
explained the purpose of our research to them.

\paragraph{Introductory questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Tell us how often and why you use Tor?
    \item Do you remember the first time you used Tor?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Expectations of privacy}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What would make you use onion services more? (speed, quality/quantity
        of content, better domain format, popular websites having onion sites)
    \item Who or what are you trying to protect yourself against when using Tor?
    \item The domain format of onion sites is weird.  How do you deal with that?
    \item Would you like it if Tor Browser automatically redirected you to onion
        sites?  Even if that were the case for all onion sites?
    \item How do you learn about new onion sites?
    \item Do you think phishing is a concern with onion sites?  How do you know
        if an onion site is legitimate?
    \item Assume you use Tor to open example.com.  Who can see what?  What if
        you open the corresponding onion site instead?
    \item What are you concerned about when using Tor?
    \item Certain things are hidden from certain entities when you are using
        Tor.  Please explain your beliefs.
    \item Some websites use ``vanity onion domains.''  Whare are your thoughts
        on that?
    \item Explain in your own words how you believe Tor works.
    \item Is there anything else about the usability of onion services that you
        wish to share?
\end{enumerate}
