\section{Interview study}
\label{sec:interview-study}

\subsection{Research ethics}
The institutional review board (IRB) of Princeton University deemed our study
exempt (IRB protocol number: 8251).  Before the interview we asked our subjects
to sign a consent form, we explicitly asked for permission to record the
conversation, and we made it clear that subjects could withdraw their consent at
any time.

\subsection{Method}
We conducted a series of semi-structured interviews to learn what is worth
asking in our surveys.

\subsubsection{Participants}
We created a pre-interview survey (see Appendix~\ref{app:interview-survey}) to
select eligible subjects.

We conducted thirteen interviews at the Citizen Lab Summer Institute 2017 in
Toronto.\footnote{Information about the conference is online at
\url{https://citizenlab.ca/summerinstitute/2017.html}.}  

We had three interviewers.  How did we split up in groups?  Were all interviews in English?
